A tool to track, predict, and avoid violent crime.

We crawl social media networks to gather connection data so that we might be able to point out the people who are the most connected to victims of violent crime. The basis of our project is that if there are persons A and B, who are victims of violent crime, and they have a mutual friend, C, then that person C is more likely to become a victim of violent crime. We are writing the code to collect data and test this theory.
